Reassembly Lens is a small image experiment concerned with mirroring,
fragmentation, and the slow loss of resolution.

An image is cropped, reflected, divided, and reassembled.
With each step, structure remains, but certainty fades.
The image is no longer read all at once, but encountered through repetition,
edges, and alignment.

The process draws from physical collage, optical devices, and simple
reordering operations rather than filters or effects.

## Approach

The work operates through a limited set of gestures:

- cropping to a square  
- mirroring across axes  
- slicing into bands  
- reordering from the outside inward  

These gestures are intentionally minimal.
Their accumulation, rather than their complexity, produces change.

As the number of divisions increases, the image shifts from recognition
toward abstraction, while traces of the original scene remain visible.

---

## States

The system moves through a small number of meaningful states.

**Original**  
A single image, centered and intact.

**Mirrored**  
The image folded into itself, forming a symmetrical field.

**Reassembled**  
The mirrored image segmented and reordered, producing a low-definition
structure that suggests depth, motion, or optical interference.

---

## Interaction

The interface allows the image to be explored rather than controlled.
Buttons and keys adjust the degree of division, rotation, and tone.
Each change re-renders the same underlying material.

The work is designed to be used slowly.
Small adjustments often produce disproportionate shifts in perception.

---

## Context

Reassembly Lens is informed by:

- cut-and-reassemble photographic practices  
- optical lenses and Fresnel structures  
- repetition and symmetry as spatial cues  
- reduced perceptual representations  

It is not a tool for enhancement, but for observation.

## Notes

This project is intentionally minimal.
Its value lies less in the outcome than in the process of transformation
and the thresholds between states.
