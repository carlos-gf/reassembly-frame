Reassembly Lens

An experiment in reduction, symmetry, and temporal perception.

This tool takes an image and subjects it to a simple operation:
mirroring, slicing, and reordering.
What emerges is not distortion, but a different way of seeing structure.

The same image can be treated in two ways:

Lens  
A spatial operation.  
The image is mirrored into four quadrants, then progressively reassembled through vertical and horizontal divisions.
As divisions increase, the image collapses into a dense, optical surface.

Color  
A temporal operation.  
The image is sampled into a square grid of colors.
Each frame reveals one slice of the image’s chromatic structure.
Over time, the full image is suggested rather than shown.

Interaction

Choose image  
Load any image.  
In Lens mode it is cropped to a square.  
In Color mode the full image is used.

+ / −  
Increase or decrease divisions (Lens)  
Increase or decrease frames (Color)

B / W  
Toggle grayscale

Rotate  
Rotate the image in 90° steps

Save  
Export the current state as an image

Keyboard controls

1 → Lens mode  
2 → Color mode  

← / → → small steps  
↑ / ↓ → larger steps  

B → Black & White  
R → Rotate  
S → Save  

Notes

This is not about reconstructing the original image.
It is about revealing latent order through reduction.

Each step removes information.
What remains becomes more legible, not less.
